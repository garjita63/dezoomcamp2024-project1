This repository contains a brief description of my DE Zoomcamp Project 1.

## Problem statement

## About the Dataset
[Retailrocket recommender system](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset) 

The dataset consists of three context files i.e. : 
1. a file with behaviour data (events.csv)
2. a file, which describes category tree (category_tree.сsv).
3. a file with item properties (item_properties_part1.сsv & item_properties_part2.csv)

The data has been collected from a real-world ecommerce website. It is raw data, i.e. without any content transformations, however, all values are hashed due to confidential issues.

The behaviour data, i.e. events like clicks, add to carts, transactions, represent interactions that were collected over a period of 4.5 months. A visitor can make three types of events, namely **view**, **addtocart** or **transaction**.
